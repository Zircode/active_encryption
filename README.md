# ActiveEncryption

ActiveEncryption transparently encrypt (and decrypt!) attributes. It works with any class, but it's primarly intended to be used with ActiveRecord models. Under the hood, it doesn't reinvent the wheel and uses the tried and tested ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'active_encryption'
```

And then execute:

```shell
bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```shell
gem install active_encryption
```

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Configuration

### Encryption setting

The following attributes are configurable in an encryption setting:

| Attribute       | Description | Default value |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| ``cipher``      | String with the encryption cipher to use. Can be any cipher returned by OpenSSL::Cipher.ciphers. | 'aes-256-gcm' |
| ``digest``      | String with the digest to use to sign. Ignored when using an AEAD cipher like 'aes-256-gcm'. | 'SHA1' |
| ``id``          | Unique ID to identify an encryption setting. It can be an Integer, String, or Symbol. | nil |
| ``key``         | Cryptographicaly random binary string of the exact size required by the cipher. E.g. 'aes-256-gcm' requires 32 bytes (256 bits). Can be generated with ``SecureRandom.bytes(32)``. It is STRONGLY recommended NOT to set this directly but to use a secret for key derivation. | nil |
| ``purpose``     | Confines the encrypted attribute to a specific purpose. See https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/MessageEncryptor.html#method-i-encrypt_and_sign | nil |
| ``secret``      | String used to derive an encryption key with PBKDF2. Can be generated with ``SecureRandom.hex(64)`` or ``SecureRandom.urlsafe_base64(64)``. | nil |
| ``secret_iterations`` | Number of iterations of PBKDF2 to derive the key from the secret. See https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/KeyGenerator.html | 65536 |
| ``secret_salt`` | Salt for PBKDF2 to derive the key from the secret. | 'ActiveEncryption default key salt' |
| ``serializer``  | Object serializer to use. E.g.: 'YAML'. | Marshal |

Keys or secrets must NEVER be stored in version control (e.g. git) or in the
database in an unencrypted form.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git
commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
