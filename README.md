# ActiveEncryption

ActiveEncryption transparently encrypt (and decrypt!) attributes. It works with any class, but it's primarly intended to be used with ActiveRecord models. Under the hood, it doesn't reinvent the wheel and uses the tried and tested ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'active_encryption'
```

And then execute:

```shell
bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```shell
gem install active_encryption
```

## Usage

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git
commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
