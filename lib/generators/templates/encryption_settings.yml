# WARNING: Changing these encryption settings prevents the decryption
# of already encrypted data.

# Default encryption setting
default:
  # secret: must be a cryptographically random string.
  # The secret is hashed with PBKDF2 to generate the encryption key.
  #
  # You can generate one with:
  # - "rails secret"
  # - SecureRandom.hex(64)
  # - or, SecureRandom.urlsafe_base64(64)
  #
  ## WARNING ##
  # The secret value should NOT be stored in this file directly.
  # You should instead refer to where the secret value is stored
  # e.g. refer to Rails credentials/secrets, an environment variable or
  # a KMS/HSM, etc.
